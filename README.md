Bare-Metal-OS
=============

Fundamental kernel/Operating System for Raspberry Pi systems. Code is written in C, but the project uses some ARM Assembly when a task is easier. The project may use more ARM Assembly in future if efficiency boosts are justified. The goal of the project, as of now, is to encourage experimentation, discovery, and transparency of how Operating Systems are built.
